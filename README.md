# GoogleBooksSearch

In this repository I created a MERN application that allows the user to search for and save books. There are two pages in this application: "Search" and "Saved". On the Search page, the user is able to search for books and then view information about them. The user has the ability to save a book, storing it in the database. If the user has the application open in multiple browsers, the notification for the saved book will appear in all of the browsers.

This application uses the Google Books API as well as Socket.IO.

## Usage

This application is simple to use. Use the search bar to search for any book you want. Note that you will always get 10 results. Click "View" to open a new tab with additional information about the book. Click "Save" to add the book to the "Saved" page for later reference. If done successfully, you will get a notification alerting the success. To view the "Saved" page, click it on the top of the page. You will be given a list of all the books you saved. From there, you can view more information about the book, or click "Delete" to remove it from your list of saved books.
